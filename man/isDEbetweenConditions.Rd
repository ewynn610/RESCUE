\title{Identify Genes Simulated to Be Differentially Expressed Between Conditions}
\usage{
isDEbetweenConditions(sce, condition1, condition2)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A \code{SingleCellExperiment} object simulated using
\code{rescueSim::simRescueData()}, with log2 fold change annotations stored in
the \code{rowData}.}

\item{condition1}{A character string specifying the first condition. This can
be a baseline reference (e.g. \code{"time0"}, \code{"group0"}, or
\code{"time0_group0"}) or a condition present in \code{rowData} (without the
\code{"deLog2FC."} prefix).}

\item{condition2}{A character string specifying the second condition,
interpreted the same way as \code{condition1}.}
}
\value{
A named logical vector indicating whether each gene was simulated to
be differentially expressed between \code{condition1} and \code{condition2}.
Names correspond to gene names.
}
\description{
Returns a logical vector indicating whether each gene was simulated to be
differentially expressed between two conditions in a
\code{SingleCellExperiment} generated by the \pkg{rescueSim} package.
}
\details{
All log2 fold changes are defined relative to a baseline or reference
condition—typically \code{"time0"}, \code{"group0"}, or
\code{"time0_group0"}—and stored in the \code{rowData} with column names of
the form \code{"deLog2FC.<condition>"}. Reference conditions are not included
in the \code{rowData}.

If one of the specified conditions is a reference, the function checks whether
the corresponding log2 fold change column is non-zero. If both are
non-reference, it checks whether the two log2 fold change columns differ.

This function does not perform a statistical test; it simply reports whether
each gene was \emph{simulated} to be differentially expressed between the two
conditions based on the stored simulation parameters.
